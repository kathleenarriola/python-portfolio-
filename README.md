# 🐍 Python Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Learning Portfolio! This repository documents my journey as I build solid foundations in Python for a future career in Data Engineering and Data Analysis.

## 📅 Week 1: Python Basics & Data Structures (June 30 – July 4, 2025)

### ✅ Topics Covered:
- Python setup and syntax
- Variables and data types
- Operators and expressions
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions and input/output
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries

### 📂 Folder Structure:

### 💡 Highlights:
- Built a simple calculator using variables and operators
- Created basic CLI apps using loops and conditionals
- Practiced organizing data using Python’s core data structures
- Completed daily exercises to reinforce each concept
- Applied all concepts in a mini-project by end of the week

### 📌 Goal:
To practice core Python concepts through consistent coding, build real examples, and prepare for more advanced topics like data manipulation, databases, and APIs.
